# Can velocity be predicted with biomechanics?

A projected completed in high school using open-source biometric data from [Driveline Baseball](https://www.drivelinebaseball.com/), a premiere, analytically-oriented baseball training centre, to examine the relationship between biometrics and pitch velocity. (August 2016). Blog post at [Danolytics](https://medium.com/danolytics/can-velocity-be-predicted-with-biomechanics-91f4cf0bee98) The blog post was subsequently tweeted out by the owner of Driveline Baseball, Kyle Boddy.

Using feature selection and linear regression, the model explained 87.56% of the variation in observed velocity and held an RMSE of 1.51 MPH.
